# Titanic-Survival-Analysis-Dashboard
In this project, I utilized Power BI and DAX to analyze the survival rates of Titanic passengers based on various factors such as gender, class, and embarkation point. I applied Power Query to clean the original dataset by merging columns, replacing values, removing unnecessary fields, and filling in missing data. The dataset included details such as passenger ID, name, survival status, gender, age, class, and fare paid.

The final dashboard provides key insights:

1.Out of 891 passengers, 342 survived, while 549 were victims.
2.Of the 342 survivors, 233 were male and 109 were female.
3.Third-class passengers accounted for 55.1% of the total, with the lowest survival rate.
4.Passengers from Southampton made up the largest group, with 644 embarking there.
5.The total fare collected was $29K, with first-class survivors accounting for $5.2K.

This dashboard allowed me to demonstrate proficiency in data cleaning, transformation, and visualization using Power BI, providing clear and insightful data-driven conclusions.
